# Password Generator Starter Code

This is my password generator created for the UNH coding bootcamp to fulfill the module 3 challenge. Upon clicking the generate password button the user is given a prompt to determine the length of the password between 8-128 characters. Once the length is determined, several prompts are posed to the user to determine what characters are included in the password. These include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers and special characters. If no characters are selected than the program resets.
